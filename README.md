# Paddy Rice Detection in China, Brazil, and Colombia - Associated with its temporal Rainfall, Temperature, Soil Moisture Variables identification 

## Javascript (in Google Earth Engine) codes:

<p>The next codes let to identify paddy rice crops at diffent latitudes (China, Brazil, and Colombia). Using remote sensors adapted in Sentinel-1 and MODIS satellite paddy rice and its phenology was classified using CART algorith in each region through 20 years.</p> <br>

<p>Besides, was defined series (Monthly) of Precipitation, Temperature, and Soil Moisture series associated with each region. </p> <br>
